# Project 3 Feedback

## Project Strengths

* Nice job committing frequently throughout the project.
* Great use of nested resources with `artists` and `reviews`.
* It was smart to use the Insgram API rather than making artists upload their own photos.
* Love the idea -- I don't think there's anything like this out there yet, and you could take it very far, even having users and artists message each other and complete transactions on the site.

## Areas of Improvement

* See code comments marked with `CJ`
* For next steps, I would work on the functionality as flagging certain users as "admins" who can add artists. You could also have a `photos` table in the database to store URLs of the Instagram photos you want for a particular artist (to avoid the personal photos that come up).
* It could also be cool for users to be able to "follow" or "favorite" artists.
* Fill out your `README` to include a little about the project, what technologies you used, and the steps to run the project locally.
